When I started making this website, I had not touched anything related to web development for at least a year.

But thanks to the internet, as long as you have a goal and the ability to follow instructions, the lack of experience will not hinder you from making your own website!


Step 1: Follow the instructions on http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ to set up a website with blog. Technically speaking, when you are done with the guide, you've already made your own webpage.

Step 2: Making the website personal by uploading images. http://solutionoptimist.com/2013/12/28/awesome-github-tricks/

Step 3: Install Github and GitShell on my computer. Go though Github concepts and play around the apps. This is crucial for designing web locally and version controlling.

Step 3: Installing Jekyll to make local web development possible.
