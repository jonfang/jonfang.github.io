First Post! Well glad that I spent some time messing around html/css/javascript during my college years that I did not spend too 
much time creating this website. 
In fact, the work is quite laughable since some genius wrote up a tutorial site that I mainly just copy and paste.
Hopefully I can do something meaningful with my blogs!
